# Portfolio

I'm a Software Engineer, writer & general tinkerer. I'm less interested in the end result and more in playing,
learning and generally drifting towards shiny things. Sometimes I finish the projects, sometimes life gets in
the way. But I made this place to share my experiments in the hope that it might help or inspire others.
