      <h5>Summary</h5>
      <section className='summary'>
        This project was a bit of a reprieve from the programming projects I usually juggle. I wanted to do something
        creative & learn a little more Blender. I quite like the look of diorama's and the concept of minitature worlds
        so I thought i'd throw this idea in and see what came of it.

          I knew I wanted something real world and began playing with the mapping offerings from Microsoft & Mapbox but
          none of them really hit the mark. They look fine when generating mountainous terrain, but I wanted to play
          with cities and they weren't up to scratch.
          <p>
            During research I came across <a href='https://renderdoc.org/'>Render Doc</a>, a free tool that enables you
            to navigate & download the OpenGL context of an application. In this case I pointed it at the navigation
            mode inside Google Maps and pulled out the information into a fully textured mesh. The mesh was dense,
            really dense, my computer sounded like it was going to take off on more than a few occasions. The texture
            quality does not hold up on closer inspection. But for the birds eye look I had in mind. It would work
            perfectly.

            I used a Blender Add On to import this large dataset itâ€™s heavy and it takes a few moments but it gives you
            a working mesh. A lot of time was spent cleaning the mesh and building out the scene. The water was replaced
            to better interact with lights and I even spent a lot of time hand animating elements in the scene; Birds,
            Traffic, Water all smoothly moved about. Unfortunately, rendering this out of Blender proved to be a
            challenge that I didn't want to spend further time on so I left it at static renders.

        Shout out to <a href='https://github.com/eliemichel/MapsModelsImporter'> this Blender plugin</a> that did the
        heavy lifting of the initial mesh.
